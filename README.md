Part 1: Includes Pattern Noise and Blury Type features extraction. The two-part noise model includes extracting noise using the traditional method and extracting it using deep learning networks. In the Blury Properties section, the required properties are extracted using MATLAB code. By extracting features (blury type and pattern noise), you can train a deep neural net for classification of deepfake face frame.



Part2: The second part, which is related to the generalizability method, consists of two codes. One section includes the limited training of the trained network with the ImageNet dataset (as pretrained net) and the other part includes the limited training of the trained network with the deep Facebook deepfake database (as pretrained net).

All code is in Pytorch, except for the Blur feature extraction section, which is in MATLAB.
